I did not read that it should be a separate file from the test.cs file so I did make the plain english tests as my first commit after setting up the files but they did not have their own file so i will just copy what i commited then here.

Test1
  the test should pass if there is no repeating word
Test2
  the test should pass if the input equals the input is the given string
Test3
  the test should pass if the input is in the string once but does not equal the string
Test4
  the test should pass if the word is in the string multipe times
Test5
  the test should pass if the word is in the string multiple times exactly as entered
